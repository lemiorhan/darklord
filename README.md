DarkLord
========

DarkLord is a Java API for Project Voldemort. It uses official Voldemort Java API and provides additional abstraction.

Project Voldemort is a distributed data store that is designed as a key-value store used by LinkedIn for high-scalability storage.

Project Voldemort already has a Java API which is used by Voldemort internally. But DarkLord provides a tiny API as an abstraction on top of official Voldemort client API.
